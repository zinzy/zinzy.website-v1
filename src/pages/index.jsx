        <h3>My experience</h3>
        <p>At present, I serve as Design & Product Manager of <a href="https://www.leeruniek.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leeruniek</a>, a scale-up in education technology. We cultivate better collaborative and analytical skills in teams of primary school teachers. <mark>Improving the lives of crucial workers</mark> by giving them the right tools and conversations is indeed very fulfilling.</p>
        <p>Previously, I spent five years at <a href="https://www.airtrade.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airtrade</a>, where I led research and design on a dozen enterprise and consumer platforms for KLM and other leaders in the travel industry. Before that, I ran Studio Zinzy for eight years, providing design and development services in health care, journalism, fine arts, academia, and other spaces.</p>

        <h3>Life is good</h3>
      <p>You may find me on the Amsterdam East side tending to the home and garden I share with <a href="https://twitter.com/anjawaleson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anja</a>. I enjoy making music, learning the love language of cooking, and exploring the worlds of theology, sociolinguistics, and technology ethics. I'm a fan of Barbra Streisand, monster movies, and terrible television. Life is truly good.</p>

        <h3>Availability</h3>
      <p>Aside from my work at Leeruniek, I sometimes engage in consulting on matters of product and design. At present, I do not have availability for this. Feel free to reach out to me, though, about your project or any other topic. I enjoy meeting new people and their stories. You can find me on <a href="mailto:zinzy@pm.me">email</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zinzy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
