        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>I'm a designer with 15 years of experience shipping products and leading design as well as product teams. I am specialized in making tools for people at work. My work is focused on organizing skill sets and relationships to demonstrate how caring for users is good for business.</p>
        <p>At present, I serve as Design & Product Manager of <a href="https://www.leeruniek.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leeruniek</a>, a scale-up in education technology. Previously, I spent five years in travel technology at <a href="https://www.airtrade.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airtrade</a>, where I led research and design on enterprise and consumer platforms. Before that, I ran Studio Zinzy for eight years, offering design and development across academia, journalism, health care, and other industries.</p>
        <p>Unprofessionally, I create resonant queer spaces. I'm on the leadership team of <a href="https://www.vineandfig.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vine & Fig</a>, an international organization for LGBTQIA+ Catholics. Every last Sunday of the month when Covid doesn't restrict intimate gatherings, I host <a href="https://www.queersalon.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Queer Salon</a> in Amsterdam. I take pleasure in cultivating environments that are intersectional, curious, and kind.</p>
        <p>You may find me on the Amsterdam East side tending to the home and garden I share with <a href="https://twitter.com/anjawaleson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anja</a>. I enjoy making music, learning the love language of cooking, and exploring the worlds of theology, sociolinguistics, and psychology. I'm a fan of Barbra Streisand, monster movies, and audio books.</p>
        <p>Life is truly good.</p>

{/* 
      <p>Hello, I'm Zinzy, a designer with 13 years of skin in the game. I deploy my multidisciplinary skillset in leadership, design thinking, and operations to help teams do better. I'm specialized in building tools that help people solve problems at work. At the moment I lead product and design at edtech startup <a href="https://www.leeruniek.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leeruniek</a>. Literally couldn't wish for better colleagues.</p>
      <p>Outside of work I build resonant queer spaces. I'm on the leadership team of <a href="https://www.vineandfig.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vine & Fig</a>, an international organization for queer Catholics. Every last Sunday of the month I host <a href="https://www.queersalon.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Queer Salon</a> in Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>You may find me on the Amsterdam East side tending to the home and garden I share with <a href="https://twitter.com/anjawaleson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anja</a>. I enjoy writing and making music, learning the love language of cooking, and discovering new wonders in the world of theology, sociolinguistics, and intersectionality. Above all, I'm a fan of Barbra Streisand, garbage television, and mediocre cinema.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to reach out to me, you can do so via <a href="mailto:zinzy@pm.me">email</a>.</p>
       <p>This here is my personal site: a collection of soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. It's built as a scavenger hunt of sorts, mildly awkward on purpose. Its contents are subject to change. A good place to start is my <a href="/Now">[[Now]]</a> page.</p> */}
