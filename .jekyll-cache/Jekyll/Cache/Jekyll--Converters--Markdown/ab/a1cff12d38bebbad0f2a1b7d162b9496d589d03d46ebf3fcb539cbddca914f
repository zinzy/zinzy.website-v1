I"ê<p>I currently enjoy full-time employment at [Leeruniek, a start-up in education technology. I joined Leeruniek predominantly because I liked the things they told me about using data for good, and working autonomously in a design-forward product team.</p>

<h5 id="may-2021---now">May 2021 - now</h5>
<p>I transitioned to the role of Product &amp; Design Manager to help make Leeruniekâ€™s product more sustainably user-centered. This job, the title of which I invented out of necessity, turns out to be a delightful, user-forward way of making a product. My team is focused on fortifying the foundation of our dashboard, and responding well to the education industryâ€™s changing focus. Helping crucial workers during the pandemic has been one of the most gratifying things Iâ€™ve done.</p>
