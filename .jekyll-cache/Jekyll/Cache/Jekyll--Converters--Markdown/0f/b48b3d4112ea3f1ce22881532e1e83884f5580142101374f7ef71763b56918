I"Ë<p>Watching this film makes me want to read the book that inspired it. I didn't know there were so many middle-aged and older Americans living this life. I also didn't know that 2007-09 was known as the Great Recession. Anja and I asked each other whether we could live a #vanlife. I think I could, for a little while. Anja told me she'd done enough of that backpacking for 18 months. Frances McDormand is so good at telling the stories of normal people.</p>
