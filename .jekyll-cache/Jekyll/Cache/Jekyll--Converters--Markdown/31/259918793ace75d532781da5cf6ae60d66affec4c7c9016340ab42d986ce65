I"h<p>In January of 2021 I created a one-pager called “Is the Pope gay?”. As is the case with so many of my other ideas, I came up with this website because something happened on the Internet: the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gay</code> domain extension had just become available. Next to isthepope.gay, I registered a wide variety of domains. My favorite was everyoneatthevaticanis.gay, which led to my own website.</p>

<p>After a year of cheap fun I’ve let go of all of my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gay</code> domains, but this project remains on <a href="https://isthepopegay.netlify.app/">Netlify</a>.</p>
