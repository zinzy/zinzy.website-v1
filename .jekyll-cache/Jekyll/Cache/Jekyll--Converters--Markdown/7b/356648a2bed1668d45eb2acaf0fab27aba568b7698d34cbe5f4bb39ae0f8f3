I")<p>In April 2020 I joined the leadership team of Vine &amp; Fig, an international online community for queer Catholics. I remember when I first found their website, hopeful and lonely about having begun to remember how much the Catholic Church feels like home, despite every single thing.</p>

<p>At Vine &amp; Fig, I was involved in social media for a while, and I facilitated live events. In the beginning of 2020 I pivoted away from social media, realizing how much itâ€™s begun to feel like work. Now I only focus on facilitation and gathering.</p>
