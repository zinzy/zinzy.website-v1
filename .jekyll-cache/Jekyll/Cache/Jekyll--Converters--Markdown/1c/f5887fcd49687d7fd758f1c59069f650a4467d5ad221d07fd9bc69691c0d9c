I"ñ<p>Since the beginning of my relationship with Anja I've been periodically baking challahs for shabbos. This page details the recipe I use, and how I've been refining it through the years.</p>

<p>I've been experimenting with dough variation, choosing a more pastry-style dough instead of something that's traditionally bready.</p>

<p>Baking bread, to me, can instantly turn into failure if what I taste three hours later isn't as fluffy and fresh as it was when it came out of the oven. Julia Turshen's recipe for jam buns turns out to be perfect for challah. I still use the braiding technique from <em>Gefilteria</em>, and substitute half of Julia's butter for olive oil to add some extra fluff. It's heaven.</p>
