<p>Whenever we go to Paris, we stay at <a href="https://www.grandpigalle.com/">Grand Pigalle H√¥tel</a>. The staff is friendly but not too friendly, the room service is awesome, and the rooms are the perfect accessory to pretending you're a Parisian for a few days.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One benefit of Grand Pigalle that cannot be overlooked is the fact that it's across from <a href="https://ilovebuvette.com">Buvette</a></li>
  <li>As a person who loves Japanese milk bread (if you don't, God help you), I never miss out on a visit to <a href="https://en.carrepaindemie.com">Carr√© Pain de Mie</a></li>
</ul>
