I"0<p>Carey Mulligan has begun to remind me of what would happen if Judith Light and Jessica Lange had had a love child. The depth in the characters she's been portraying recently is honestly such a joy to watch.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that this movie's ending does justice to her character but not to the truth, I loved experiencing this story without knowing a single thing about it.</p>

<p>In our lesbian abode we often joke about how awful men can be, but I do genuinely hope that whoever is raising future men does better than our parents (and their parents and their parents) did for us.</p>

<p>If anything, <em>Promising Young Woman</em> confirms to me how important the [[mens liberation movement]] really is to anything that requires introspection and humility of people in a dominant social group.</p>
