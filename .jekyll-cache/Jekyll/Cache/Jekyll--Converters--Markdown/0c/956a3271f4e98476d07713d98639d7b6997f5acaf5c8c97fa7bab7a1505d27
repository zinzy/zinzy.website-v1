I"…<p>RSVPâ€™d to my first-ever Homebrew get-together on May 4th. Iâ€™m curious to see who will be there, and a tad nervous about not being dorky enough. A while ago I made the distinction between Anja and myself by saying sheâ€™s a full-on dork, and Iâ€™m a dork with a hint of cool because Iâ€™m in IT, and then she rolled her eyes at me by using her eyes and, really, her entire head.</p>
