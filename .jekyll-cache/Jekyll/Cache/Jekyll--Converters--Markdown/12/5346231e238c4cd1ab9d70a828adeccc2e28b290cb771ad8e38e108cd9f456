I"É<p>Much like you, I very much enjoy browsing the IndieWeb using <a href="https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/">Indieweb webrings</a>. When I stumbled upon your post, and saw my website listed as one of your new finds, my heart skipped a beat. Since I donâ€™t make an effort to be found on the Internet, I forget people ever even find my website. I imagine this is what it must feel like to make contact again with another human after an apocalypse, divided by 1,000.</p>
