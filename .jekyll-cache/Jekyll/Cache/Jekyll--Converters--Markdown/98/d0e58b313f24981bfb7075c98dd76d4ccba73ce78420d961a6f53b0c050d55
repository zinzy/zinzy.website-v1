I"µ<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11161474/"><em>Pieces of a Woman</em></a> is the first film that made me feel like someone was actually giving birth on screen. It's also a really wonderful way to get to know the work of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3948952/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Vanessa Kirby</a>, who is a blast both here and on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_11"><em>The Crown</em></a>.</p>
