I"ò<p>I saw <em>Midsommar</em> in a theatre in the Summer of 2019. Florence Pugh might be my favorite actress of her generation. The way she grieves, cry-stumbling over her own coughs, and the way her face moves kept me glued to the screen.</p>

<p>The photography and sound design of this film are something else. Iâ€™m sure, comparing it to <a class="internal-link" href="/hereditary">hereditary</a> Iâ€™ll be able to sraw parallels in Ari Asterâ€™s directing, but when I watch <em>Midsommar</em>, I feel it is unlike anything Iâ€™ve ever seen. The intoxicating sounds of the small Swedish commune, and the bright colors add to the filmâ€™s uncanniness, and I like it they way.</p>

<p>It reminds me of <em><a href="https://www.frisospoelstra.com/portfolio/G0000K5OxBhSJBOw">Devils &amp; Angels: Ritual Feasts in Europe</a></em> by Friso Spoelstra.</p>

<p>In general, I aim to steer clear of snobbery, but the work of Ari Aster truly is elevated horror, and Iâ€™m one of the genreâ€™s most shameless fans.</p>
