I"æ<p>Itâ€™s odd to think about what life was like in the Spring of 2021, or even 2020. Sure, we were definitely working on our little street-side garden, hoping to bring some color to the neighborhood, but other than that, not much was the same at home. We had a living room office, each with our own command center. Now, things are slowly returning to normal. Weâ€™ve installed new kitchen counters, getting our couch reupholstered. It feels like the house is becoming a home again.</p>
