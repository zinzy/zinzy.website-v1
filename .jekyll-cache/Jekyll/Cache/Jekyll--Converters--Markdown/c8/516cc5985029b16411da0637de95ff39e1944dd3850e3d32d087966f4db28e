I")<p>The digital garden is the latest trend in online publishing: a publicly available collection of notes in various stages of refinement, tended to and updated online for everyone to see. It sits snuggly in between a blog and a one-person wiki.</p>

<p>To me, it’s the culmination of the folder plain text files I’ve been maintaining since around 2005, which exist in my <a class="internal-link" href="/second-brain">Second brain</a>. The ones you can see here have been made available to the public. the vast majority of them are kept private for a myriad of reasons.</p>

<p>This space has been around since 2004, in a variety of shapes and under a lot of different names. It has been a blog, a photo blog, a portfolio, a directory, and a one-pager. Its first name was doyoulikemytightsweater.com.</p>
