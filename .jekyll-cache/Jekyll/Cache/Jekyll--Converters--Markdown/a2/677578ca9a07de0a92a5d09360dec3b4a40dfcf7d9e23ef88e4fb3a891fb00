I"&<p>I'm a digital designer with about 15 years of experience crafting web products for organizations and professionals in the Netherlands and abroad. Approaching design as a strategic effort, my responsibilities are usually quite broad, and often include exploratory and evaluative user and product research, holistic design, setting up design systems, and setting up DesignOps and ResearchOps.</p>

<p>I currently enjoy full-time employment at [[Leeruniek]], a start-up in education technology.</p>

<h5 id="may-2021---now">May 2021 - now</h5>
<p>I transitioned to the role of Product &amp; Design Manager to help make Leeruniek's product more sustainably user-centered. This job, the title of which I invented out of necessity, turns out to be a delightful, user-forward way of making a product. My team is focused on fortifying the foundation of our dashboard, and responding well to the education industry's changing focus. Helping crucial workers during the pandemic has been one of the most gratifying things I've done.</p>

<h5 id="december-2020---april-2021">December 2020 - April 2021</h5>
<p>I joined Leeruniek as a Design Strategist in their Product team, focusing on holistic product design, and establishing a UX practice.</p>

<p>As Lead Designer, I built a UX lab from scratch, as well as a design system powering over a dozen industry-leading travel brands. Being the company's first designer in-house was a challenge at times, but it did teach me volumes about building transparent stakeholder relationships. My proudest achievement at Airtrade was Propeller, a design system I built to power our white label tools as well as all other platforms in the company.</p>

<h5 id="2015---2017">2015 - 2017</h5>
<p>I joined the company as a Lead Developer on one of their front-end teams. Early on, I began transitioning to design work, which was a natural fit for me.</p>

<p>Between 2007 and 2015 I ran my own one-person design studio. Exploring various creative disciplines and front-end development, I worked with artists, magazines, academia, journalists, health care professionals, both in large organisations and for local businesses, in teams of tech professionals and by myself.</p>

<h3 id="my-background">My background</h3>
<p>I grew up a teenager of the Internet, getting my first computer at 10, and teaching myself how to make webpages at 11. Expressing myself in rectangular digital format, and making friends while doing so, has been a natural activity for me since then.</p>

<p>Studio Zinzy was born out of convenience: it existed already in the photography and design gigs I had been doing late in high school, just without the name and paper work. It also proved a solid way to support myself through college, where I first dabbled in psychology, and then focused on literature and theology.</p>

<p>People sometimes jokingly ask me how my fields of study apply to my work as a designer, assuming they aren't connected at all. To me, and I see this in my peers often, attending university was much more about amplifying my (visual) literacy, conducting good research, and thinking critically than anything else.</p>

<p>I actually believe that literature and theology have been great contributors to how I do my work today. UX is as much about text as it isn't. Having a critical eye for detail in writing UX copy has had a proven positive impact on the users of products I've made. Furthermore, my focus on design as a vehicle for inclusivity could not exist without the things I've learnt  about narratology, epistemology, intersectionality, and decolonizing Christianity.</p>

<p>After 15 years, I feel comfortable calling myself a designer, getting paid as one, and mentoring others who want to be (better at being) one. As with most people, this wasn't always the case. I've certainly been one to underestimate my capabilities, to let other people define what I can call myself, and to be made feel small by people with a specialisation in the field in which I now work.</p>

<p>Today, I see there's value in having diversity in design, and as a true generalist, I know what I am good at, what I want to learn, and what I like to leave to others. I got to this mindset by finding an environment that is kind, supportive, and curious.</p>
