I"B<p>Today, during my Saturday morning coffee run, I bumped into a Dutch-Sri Lankan acquaintance. My favorite barista took one look at us and said "are you sisters?" She then got embarrassed and immediately went on a lunch break. It was refreshing to experience such an event in the presence of another person of color.</p>
