I"<p>In the ocean of harsh, ridiculing, and vulgar depictions of what it means to receive social security from the English government, <em>I, Daniel Blake</em> is a very welcome surprise.</p>

<p>I love how this film manages to tell a strong story without resorting to platitudes. I hate how uncomfortable it makes me feel about poverty. I love the tenderness it captures, not just between individuals but also in the silence of their loneliness. I hate how little time of my life I spend helping people in need.</p>
