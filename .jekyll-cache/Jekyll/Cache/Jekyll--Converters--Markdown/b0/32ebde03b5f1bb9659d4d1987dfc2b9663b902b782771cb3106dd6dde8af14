I"z<p>In order to achieve a well-balanced color scheme, Erica Schoonmaker introduced <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/166246-My-Secret-for-Color-Schemes">Cohesive Colors</a> in a 2016 Dribbble shot. To ensure that a color scheme doesn’t consist of both harsh and soft tones, which usually doesn’t work outside of <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com">brutalist design</a>, she overlays a central color on the others with reduced opacity, and chooses the colors that result from it.</p>

<p>I’ve been using this method for years to create and clean up color libraries.</p>

<p>I recently learned that Javier Bórquez made a nifty <a href="https://javier.xyz/cohesive-colors/">tool</a> for it. That’s great, because I’d been making screenshots for years, and results varied depending on the environment in which these screenshots were being used. Figma, I’m looking at you.</p>
