I"—<p>This television series goes to show that, if I werenâ€™t a lesbian, I would probably be at risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybristophilia">writing men in prison</a>. Binging through this entire show in three days, I managed to entangle myself in the violent and perfectly-aesthetic vulnerability of the showâ€™s serial killer so thoroughly that, months on, I still canâ€™t break free.</p>
