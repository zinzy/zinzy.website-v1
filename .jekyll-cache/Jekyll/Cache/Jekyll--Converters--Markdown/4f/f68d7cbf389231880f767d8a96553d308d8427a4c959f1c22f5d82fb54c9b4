I"≠<p>We finished watching <em>Sound of Metal</em>. Its sound mix is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced. When I think of going deaf I think of the other option in the thought experiment: going blind. I‚Äôd pick going deaf any day, despite my musical abilities. Until seeing this film, I‚Äôd never thought of going deaf in its terrifying isolation.</p>

She‚Äôs terrified of what a hearing aid may sound like. I‚Äôm browsing the web for apps that teach sign language.</p>

<p>In bed, as I showcase how to sign to ten in Dutch, she asks: ‚Äúdo you know what the sign for Jew is?‚Äù She looks at me with the eyes of a woman who can‚Äôt believe she still has to remind the world to #neverforget, and makes a Pinocchio nose.</p>
