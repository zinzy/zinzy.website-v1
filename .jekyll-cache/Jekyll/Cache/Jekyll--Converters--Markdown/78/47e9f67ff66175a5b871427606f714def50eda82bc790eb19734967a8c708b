I"3<p>The tagline of <a href="https://heardle.app">Heardle</a> should be: "wow, though, music, huh?"</p>

<p>I was introduced to Heardle by Anja, who it from The Roxane Gay Agenda. If you're not familiar with it, Heardle is a web-based game that allots a player six attempts to guess a song. It's Wordle for music. I've been playing Heardle since the day I met it. I currently hold a 75% success rate. I'm not strong on pop music from the past five years.</p>

<p>What I find utterly endearing about Heardle, is that it's not a game. Heardle is an ode to music.</p>
