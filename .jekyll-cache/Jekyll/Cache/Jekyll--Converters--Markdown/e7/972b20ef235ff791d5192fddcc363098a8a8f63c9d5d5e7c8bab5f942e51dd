<h4 id="im-thinking-of-moving-into-ux-can-we-chat">I'm thinking of moving into UX. Can we chat?</h4>
<p>Sure! Check out my [[mentoring]] page to see if I have any availability.</p>

<h4 id="can-you-help-me-with-my-personal-brand--logo--website">Can you help me with my personal brand / logo / website?</h4>
<p>No. While I enjoyed running my own design studio for eight years, my design efforts these days are geared towards tools that people use at work. I can tell you this, though <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> gives most individual website owners what they need, and if you're a one-person company you don't need a logo.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-interview-you-for-my-podcast">Can I interview you for my podcast?</h4>
<p>Probably! I enjoy speaking about my work in design and product, as well as intersectionality, anti-racism, queer Christianity, and what it means to be a queer Afropean Catholic. Send me an [[About|email]] and I'll let you know if I have time.</p>

<h4 id="can-you-write-something-for-me">Can you write something for me?</h4>
<p>Maybe. On occasion, I write Scripture reflections or essays about queer Catholicism. If you're interested in something like that, email me about your request and let's chat!</p>

<h3 id="things-about-me">Things about me</h3>

<h4 id="you-call-yourself-a-product--design-manager-are-you-a-designer-or-a-product-manager">You call yourself a Product &amp; Design Manager. Are you a designer or a product manager?</h4>
<p>Both, but mostly I like to call myself a designer who manages product. I don't see myself ever moving into product management that doesn't involve design expertise. For companies such as [[Leeruniek]], combining these two roles is a great fit, and I can see the same for many other start-ups and scale-ups.</p>
