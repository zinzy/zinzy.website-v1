I"–<p>Hello, Iâ€™m Zinzy (she/they). I build digital products, currently serving as Product &amp; Design Manager at <a href="/leeruniek">Leeruniek</a>. Iâ€™ve been building websites, products, and teams for 15 years. I moonlight as a queer facilitator with <a href="/vine-and-fig">Vine &amp; Fig</a> and <a href="/queer-salon">Queer Salon</a>. I live in Amsterdamâ€™s finest neighborhood with <a href="https://anjawaleson.notion.site/anjawaleson/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55">my dynamite partner</a>.</p>

<p>This is my <a href="/personal-site">personal site</a>, a place I come to link and think. It contains a <a href="#changelog">changelog</a> with casual updates on a variety of subjects, as well as a collection of loosely-related notes and things I watch, read, and listen to. This space is designed like a scavenger hunt. A good place to start is my <mark><a href="/now">now page</a></mark>.</p>
