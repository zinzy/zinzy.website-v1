I"ê<p>As the lines between the nature of what I publish here begin to slowly blur, I want to remind myself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any temporal information is usually best stored in the Changelog</li>
  <li>While any note on a topic, however big or small and however vague of detailed, should be in Notes</li>
  <li>And any note the main subject of which is a title of sorts should go in the Library</li>
</ul>
