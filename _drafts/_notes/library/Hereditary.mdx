I found this highly-anticipated 2018 horror quite disappointing, not in the last place because of the mental health red herrings. In my opinion, allusions to psychopathy, schizofrenia, and severe self harm worked perfectly well with the scary things the family was experiencing, but I would rather the ending had more to do with what those things mean for character focalization and less with the cult they were running in the attic.
