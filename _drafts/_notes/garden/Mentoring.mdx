As [Diana Kimball Berlin](https://dianaberlin.com/) wrote on her original [/mentoring page](https://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring-is): "every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have. I believe that hopes, dreams, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and it’s important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others."

At the moment, I have limited availability to provide guidance to people who are interested in it. Reach out to me with an email at [zinzy@pm.me](mailto:zinzy@pm.me) answering the following questions, and I'll get back to you!

1. Who are you, what's your story, and where do you want to go?
2. What do you hope to gain from speaking with me?
3. What's something that inspired you recently?
