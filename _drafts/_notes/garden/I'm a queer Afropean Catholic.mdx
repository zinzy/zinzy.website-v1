I grew up in the Dutch South, and in line with Western stereotypes, being a Catholic was always very much a casual ordeal. I'll be updating this page with some more details about how I came to accept the inherent conflict of identifying as a queer Afropean Catholic, but for now, feel free to listen to [[Tabard Inn S1E23]].

Some things I consider in choosing to call myself this:
- How were the journeys of my African ancestors affected by the Catholic Church?
- What Church traditions do I partake in, knowing that my financial contributions may directly award the violent, discriminatory behavior of Church officials?
- Do I expose myself to anti-LGBTQIA+ rhetoric during services?
- (How) do I speak up when I see acts of violence and oppression?
