### On the Floor
So far, my 2021 has been dominated by a single repeat of _On the Floor_ by Perfume Genius. There was a wonderful late night talk show performance of the song on YouTube, but I can't find it anymore. Michael Hadreas fits neatly in the category "gay men who make me wish I were a gay man", and I find both his voice and dancing for this particular performance absolutely exhilirating. The way he moves as if it is just him in an empty room releases a vulnerability I find very hard to ignore. Pitchfork had Michael do [a nice breakdown of each song on his new album](https://pitchfork.com/features/song-by-song/perfume-genius-breaks-down-every-song-on-his-beguiling-new-album-set-my-heart-on-fire-immediately/) _Set My Heart On Fire Immediately_. 

### Prayer songs
I discovered that the easiest for me to ease into a prayerful mood is when I listen to instrumental americana. There's something about this genre There's a great playlist on Spotify:

### Other gems
It was through the documentary film [_Time_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11416746/) that I discovered the gorgeous instrumental piano music of Ethiopean nun Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou:

My upstairs neighbor Refael moved into our apartment building around the time he was sacked from _The Voice of Holland_. Luckily for me he's got a voice like an angel.
