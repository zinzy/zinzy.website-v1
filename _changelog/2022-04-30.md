As the lines between the nature of what I publish here begin to slowly blur, I want to remind myself:
- Any temporal information is usually best stored in the Changelog
- While any note on a topic, however big or small and however vague of detailed, should be in Notes
- And any note the main subject of which is a title of sorts should go in the Library
