<h2>Why Amsterdam works for me</h2>
<p>To my surprise, when people outside of the city tell me about Amsterdam, they share their assumptions about how much I must appreciate the culture the city has to offer.</p>
<p>Having grown up in the South of the Netherlands as a queer person of color, I've become intimately familiar with what it means to be The Other. Amsterdam is one of the few places in the Netherlands that doesn't cultivate this feeling. </p>
