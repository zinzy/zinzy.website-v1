<p>I'm a designer and facilitator from Amsterdam. I combine my skills in research, strategy, design, and facilitation to show brands that caring for users is good for business. Primarily, I'm a people nerd. Thank you for visiting my personal website. I come here to link and think, share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear.</p>
<h2>Get in touch</h2>

<h2>About this space</h2>
<p>At the moment, this site serves as a playground to help me build my own <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">static site generator</a>. This <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> is part of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWeb</a>, a community of friendly geeks who appreciate autonomy, hand-made web pages, and digital creativity as much as I do. The weird-looking scavenger hunt vibe is not a bug, it's a feature.</p>
<h2>Now</h2>

<ul>
<li>Reading Zadie Smith's <em>On Beauty</em>, enjoying it so far</li>
<li>Building a sustainable meditation practice by engaging in daily unguided sessions (which, as it turns out, is a lot more relaxing than finding the perfect guided meditation on the perfect app)</li>
<li>Training my product management muscle by having difficult internal conversations about priorities</li>
<li>Thoroughly enjoying mentoring on ADPList.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>For fifteen years, I've been researching, designing, and building things for the Internet. Having gained experience with brands large and small and solutions for consumers as well as businesses, I've come to specialize in building tools that help people solve problems at work. At the moment, I'm a happy member of the tribe at <a href="https://leeruniek.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leeruniek</a>, a scale-up in educational technology.</p>
<p>Before Leeruniek I spent five years in travel technology at Airtrade, where I built a UX practice from the ground up, and where I built a design system catering to a dozen large travel brands. I cut my teeth in Studio Zinzy, which I led between 2008 and 2015, taking on freelance projects in academia, journalism, healthcare, and fine arts.</p>
<h3>Mentoring</h3>
<p>Since March 2022 I've been a part of ADPList's international community of mentors. At the moment, I'm available for mentoring on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You may book a free session with me via <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADPList</a>.</p>
<h2>Facilitation</h2>
<p>I moonlight as a queer Catholic facilitator. I'm part of the leadership team of <a href="https://vineandfig.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vine &amp; Fig</a>, an international community for queer Catholics. When not on hiatus, I host <a href="https://meetup.com/queersalon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Queer Salon</a> every last Sunday of the month in Amsterdam.</p>
