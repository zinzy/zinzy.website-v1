Hello, I'm <span>Zinzy Nev Geene</span> (1987), a design researcher and queer facilitator in Amsterdam.

At present, I'm the Design + Product Manager of <a href="https://www.leeruniek.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leeruniek</a>, a scale-up in education technology. I love organizing skill sets and relationships to demonstrate how caring for users is good for business.

I'm part of the leadership team of <a href="https://www.vineandfig.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vine & Fig</a>, an international community for LGBTQIA+ Catholics. I facilitate gatherings, and write and speak about what it means to be a queer Catholic of color.

I appreciate <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brutalist</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWeb</a> principles. You may connect with me via <a href="mailto:zinzy@pm.me" rel="me">email</a>.
