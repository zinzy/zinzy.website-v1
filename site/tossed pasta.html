<p>title: "Tossed pasta"

<p><em>Serves 2, takes 1 hour</em></p>
<p>Okay listen. I've had dozens of conversations across the span of my life with people who had been to Italy and who — quite snobbishly, if you ask me — told me that Real Italian Pasta™ is made up of only a few ingredients. I've always known they were right. I've also seen this principle used and abused more than I care to remember.</p>
<p>"Less Is More" in cooking is dangerous in the hands of the wrong cook. You know the one. The "I Don't Need A Recipe I've Been Cooking For Half A Century" cook (my mother). The "I'm a Vegetarian and I Keep Things Simply Simple" cook. This recipe is a wonderful reminder that, with cooking, the devil is in the details.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1.5 kg of roma (!) tomatoes</li>
<li>3 garlic bulbs (yes)</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tbsp sugar </li>
<li>3 tbsp olive oil for tomatoes</li>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil for pasta </li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heat the oven to 200°C</li>
<li>Cut the head (where the clove is attached to the bulb) off all garlic cloves, leaving on the rest of the skin</li>
<li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper so that it sticks up against the walls of the baking sheet (this is needed to keep all the moisture in)</li>
<li>Add the roma tomatoes to the baking sheet, pushing them all to one side</li>
<li>Spread individual garlic bulbs across the tomatoes</li>
<li>Sprinkle tomatoes and garlic cloves evenly with olive oil</li>
<li>Toss</li>
<li>Spread tomatoes and garlic cloves evenly across the sheet (if you don't, the tomatoes will steam and not roast)</li>
<li>Sprinkle with salt and sugar</li>
<li>Roast for 20 minutes</li>
<li>Bring a large pan of water to a boil</li>
<li>After 20 minutes, check and toss, making sure you don't let any liquid spill over the edges of the parchment paper</li>
<li>Roast tomatoes and garlic for another 20-30 minutes until the tomatoes and garlic look like they're about to burn</li>
<li>Add salt to boiling water</li>
<li>Add pasta and cook for the specified time </li>
<li>Once tomatoes and garlic look like they're about to burn, take the baking sheet out of the oven</li>
<li>With each individual garlic clove, take the clove and squeeze its butt so that the contents will fall out. Add contents to a separate bowl. Once you've handled all of them, add naked cloves back to the tomatoes.</li>
<li>Drain the pasta in a colander, add 1 tbsp of olive oil and toss to prevent sticking. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
<li>Taking three parchment paper corners in one hand, create a little shoot with the remaining corner, and transfer the entire contents of the baking sheet to the bowl with pasta</li>
<li>Toss, toss, toss, toss, toss</li>
<li>Add some micro basil leaves and parmezzan</li>
<li>Serve immediately</li>
