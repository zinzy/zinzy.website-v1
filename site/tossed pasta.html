<p>title: "Tossed pasta"

<p><em>Serves 2, takes 1 hour</em></p>
<p>Okay listen. I've had dozens of conversations across the span of my life with people who had been to Italy and who ‚Äî quite snobbishly, if you ask me ‚Äî told me that Real Italian Pasta‚Ñ¢ is made up of only a few ingredients. I've always known they were right. I've also seen this principle used and abused more than I care to remember.</p>
<p>"Less Is More" in cooking is dangerous in the hands of the wrong cook. You know the one. The "I Don't Need A Recipe I've Been Cooking For Half A Century" cook (my mother). The "I'm a Vegetarian and I Keep Things Simply Simple" cook. This recipe is a wonderful reminder that, with cooking, the devil is in the details.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1.5 kg of roma (!) tomatoes</li>
<li>3 garlic bulbs (yes)</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tbsp sugar </li>
<li>3 tbsp olive oil for tomatoes</li>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil for pasta </li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heat the oven to 200¬∞C</li>
<li>Cut the head (where the clove is attached to the bulb) off all garlic cloves, leaving on the rest of the skin</li>
<li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper so that it sticks up against the walls of the baking sheet (this is needed to keep all the moisture in)</li>
<li>Add the roma tomatoes to the baking sheet, pushing them all to one side</li>
<li>Spread individual garlic bulbs across the tomatoes</li>
<li>Sprinkle tomatoes and garlic cloves evenly with olive oil</li>
<li>Toss</li>
<li>Spread tomatoes and garlic cloves evenly across the sheet (if you don't, the tomatoes will steam and not roast)</li>
<li>Sprinkle with salt and sugar</li>
<li>Roast for 20 minutes</li>
<li>Bring a large pan of water to a boil</li>
<li>After 20 minutes, check and toss, making sure you don't let any liquid spill over the edges of the parchment paper</li>
<li>Roast tomatoes and garlic for another 20-30 minutes until the tomatoes and garlic look like they're about to burn</li>
<li>Add salt to boiling water</li>
<li>Add pasta and cook for the specified time </li>
<li>Once tomatoes and garlic look like they're about to burn, take the baking sheet out of the oven</li>
<li>With each individual garlic clove, take the clove and squeeze its butt so that the contents will fall out. Add contents to a separate bowl. Once you've handled all of them, add naked cloves back to the tomatoes.</li>
<li>Drain the pasta in a colander, add 1 tbsp of olive oil and toss to prevent sticking. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
<li>Taking three parchment paper corners in one hand, create a little shoot with the remaining corner, and transfer the entire contents of the baking sheet to the bowl with pasta</li>
<li>Toss, toss, toss, toss, toss</li>
<li>Add some micro basil leaves and parmezzan</li>
<li>Serve immediately</li>
