<article class='h-entry'><h1>UXinsight Festival 2022</h1>
<p>These are the notes I took during the <a href="https://uxinsight.org/ux-research-conference-festival-2022/">UXinsight Festival 2022</a>.</p>
<h2>General</h2>
<h2>Talks</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<h3>Being in possible futures?</h3>
<p>by <a href="sarah-pink.md">Sarah Pink</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Didn't use slides, doesn't like them on a big screen when she's not there in person, will show video and images of projects</li>
<li>Trailer "Digital Energy Futures"<ul>
<li>Automatically charging devices</li>
<li>Giving up control to system that optimizes energy use</li>
<li>Is it realistic / desirable?</li>
<li>Project generates new insights about trends by investigating people's lives and futures</li>
<li>"Automation takes choice away"</li>
<li>Optimizing <strong>every-day lives</strong></li>
<li>Technology should be aligned with human futures</li>
<li>"Technology should expand what you can do, not restrict it"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project:<ul>
<li>Good example of research she does</li>
<li>She's a design anthropologist: tries to get into people's lives with them, spends time in every-day worlds</li>
<li>Uses film in most of her work as a way of exploring lives, participatory observation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broken starting point to use your own perspective<ul>
<li>Example: bought a house, wanted it to be different</li>
<li>Third room in the attic</li>
<li>Could sense / feel what that future would be like</li>
<li>The way we experience futures isn't always we can talk about, sometimes it's very sensual</li>
<li>We need research methods to help people think of these futures, that's why film can be interesting</li>
<li>It's difficult to speak about but easier to do in performative ways</li>
<li>Her books<ul>
<li>"Doing Visual Ethnography"</li>
<li>"Doing Sensory Ethnography"</li>
<li>"Everyday Automation" (edited)<ul>
<li>Looking at automation through every-day lives</li>
<li>People do things differently from what industry can imagine<ul>
<li>Examples: <ul>
<li>Myth: set and forget, We assume people want to set up automated system and forgot "set and forget" system, but research shows that people want to have an active relationship with a system</li>
<li>Myth: people want automation: Most people don't want full automation, even though industry thinks we do (people will use separate technologies)</li>
<li>Myth: charging electric vehicles at work, research shows people want to do it at home at night</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sometimes we want to experience what possible futures might feel like<ul>
<li>that's where we can find out what values, priorities might be, what kind of ethics, how will all of this guide them?</li>
<li>it's difficult to ask it, she's developed methods to do this research:<ul>
<li>experiment with people going into possible futures, studying self-driving cars: ask people to drive simulated / Wizard of Oz / automated car, person doesn't know it's not a self-driving car, people experienced life as they never did</li>
<li>other study: cocreate possible future air technologies, research shows that air heating and cooling would also person purification. Question: invent the tech, but also role-play being the technology, this helped researchers understand values </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>city of Melbourne: where are the sensors in the park (sensor for air quality etc., how much rubish in the bin, how many people sit on the bench): what if you were a sensor, what would you measure, who would you share the data with?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future-focused methods, what other methods does Sarah use? Can I see it in her research?</li>
<li>"Smart Homes for Seniors"<ul>
<li>Based on visual ethnography</li>
<li>Selected a group of seniors to participate in documentary</li>
<li>As researchers they learned how seniors used smart home technology</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question from Odette Jansen</li>
<li>Question from Danielle Duijst: Thanks for your interesting talk Sarah. I'm just curious how do you come up with these creative research methods? Any specific approach you take for that<ul>
<li>Ethnographic documentary film methods</li>
<li>She trained as an anthropological film maker </li>
<li>Sensor method: brainstorm "how do we find the best way to engage people?"<ul>
<li>They tested the method themselves</li>
<li>Damn that's interesting, research method design</li>
<li>We don't use the same method again</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Thoughts afterwards</h4>
<ul>
<li>What's the value of saying "future"? Wouldn't "solution space" be enough? Or is that too focused on working towards evaluative research, and is the focus here more exploratory</li>
</ul>
<h3>Leverage Secondary Research in your Practice</h3>
<p>By <a href="xenia-avezov.md">Xenia Avezov</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Why and how, not just to enrich career but to get a fuller data set</li>
<li>Chronically underused in UXR/tech</li>
<li>Better understand context</li>
<li>Build on flawed and limited sample sets</li>
<li>Product orgs want customer feedback: "would users 'like' this?" (that's not what I do, define target audience &gt; behavior/attitudinal data)</li>
<li>Stakeholders love a good quote (NPS scores :eyeroll:)</li>
<li>We're overly indexing primary research</li>
<li>We think that if we learn from users, but that's not it</li>
<li>We rarely get to do the research we want to do, there are constraints:<ul>
<li>Academics start by understanding the state of the art by doing secondary research</li>
<li>We have a negative bias about secondary research, we want to make the stuff ourselves</li>
<li>What's wrong with our echo? </li>
<li>Effort justification theory: if we apply more effort it must be more worthwhile<ul>
<li>Cognitive dissonance</li>
<li>Xenia thinks that's how we value primary research</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generic types of research<ul>
<li>Impractical without secondary research<ul>
<li>Exploratory: what problems should we solve?</li>
<li>Foundational: how do people experience a problem?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impractical without primary research</li>
<li>Generative: what solution can solve this problem?</li>
<li>Evaluative: does the solution work?</li>
<li>Or look at it as a spectrum: learn heavily on primary / secondary research</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overreliance on primary research<ul>
<li>Indexes practice towards what and how = solution space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simon Sinek "Start With Why"<ul>
<li>The golden triangle: leaders, products, and organisations start with the why</li>
<li>Fully understanding why / purpose makes them more effective</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Secondary research uncovers context users live in<ul>
<li>Leans heavily on the why</li>
<li>Not just once</li>
<li>Researchers can't afford to answer the questions why once</li>
<li>Knowing why makes us more motivated and focused</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Research not grounded in systemic, holistic environment is incomplete</li>
<li>Systemic thinking 101, Two main paradigms in science:<ul>
<li>Analysis: reductionism<ul>
<li>Penguin as the sum of its parts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Systems thinking / synthesis / holism<ul>
<li>How are things interconnected, dependent on one another</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Systems thinking case study<ul>
<li>Working at HealthTech company, focusing on diabetic patients</li>
<li>Company decided to pivot to solving more problems for patients</li>
<li>Process to identify conditions to research</li>
<li>Tried to understand: how do diabetic patients experience health care, what kind of gaps can we fill?</li>
<li>Where to start with secondary research?<ul>
<li>Applying system analysis helped:<ul>
<li>Start by identifying the systems people belong to (found two: biological, intersectional factors that affect health; healthcare system)</li>
<li>Took each systems and identified elements in each system, how do systems connect with each other</li>
<li>Helped them scope what to ask patients in primary research</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does secondary research change ability to be strategic?</li>
<li>How we can be more strategic<ul>
<li>As researchers we can help organization solve the right problem at the right time for the right people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: top 3 best practices for secondary research<ul>
<li>Outline: identify system so I can ask many questions in the outline as possible, what direction and shape do I want to scope this in, then narrow it down</li>
<li>Letting go: you're trying to carve balance between what you found out and where stakeholders are at. Only your deepest nerdy friends are gonna know what you know.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: what sources do you use to gain that data?<ul>
<li>Nerding out: brainstorm for sources </li>
<li>It depends on your domain: in this domain, where would I have information?</li>
<li>Statistical info available, associations, previous research, etc.</li>
<li>Look at the footnotes</li>
<li>Librarians are really good at this<ul>
<li>Her favorite librarian would help her brainstorm</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: did your research strategy change?<ul>
<li>Her career strategy is "don't ask, just do whatever you want"</li>
<li>"I don't expect a patient to understand how their biological context affected their choices"</li>
<li>I want to help understand what a patient says, and give it respect and context and texture</li>
<li>Sample sizes: tech does research too quickly, not academic</li>
<li>I'm scared of not getting the right sample size, or research halting progress</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: how do you scope secondary research?<ul>
<li>Have fun, get creative</li>
<li>Discuss it with people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question ???<ul>
<li>Educate people as a researcher</li>
<li>Centralize internal insights</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Power of Saying No</h3>
<p>By Ilse Blom</p>
<ul>
<li>The ROI of UXR is becoming more clear, but the questions are outweighing the velocity of research</li>
<li>Saying no can help: it's difficult because we're human and we're researchers </li>
<li>If we deliver insights, others need to act</li>
<li>UXR mission &gt; vission &gt; goal<ul>
<li>Why do we exist?</li>
<li>Where are we heading as a team?</li>
<li>How to progress in that direction?</li>
<li>Mission can last forever, vision is 2-3 years</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Team workshop:<ul>
<li>What were we most proud of in the last year?</li>
<li>Wouldn't it be fantastic if...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mission: "We as UXR team help product teams understand and empathize with the needs and experience of their users so they can develop..."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating Value: What, Who, &amp; How?</h3>
<p>Jacob Harbord</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of explicit thinking about process of value creation leads to reduced satisfaction about value of research projects</li>
<li>How to measure value of research<ul>
<li>Making better decisions</li>
<li>We need to be agnostic about how we make those decisions</li>
<li>Method doens't matter: as long as the decisions are better</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Has framework alternative to Double Diamond:<ul>
<li>Don't organize decisions in linear, time-based way</li>
<li>Matrix: specific/general - tactical/strategic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decisions: use limited information to move projects forward</li>
<li>Types of deciders:<ul>
<li>Busy deciders: high-level recommendations with just enough details to build credibility</li>
<li>Involved practitioner: powerful insights and contextual understanding</li>
<li>Enthusiastic learner: need consumer understanding, would benefit from training</li>
<li>Sceptical avoider: research shouldn't influence their own work too much</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tailor work to stakeholder perspective, and expand scope of research functions</li>
<li>Value:<ul>
<li>Insight (primary research)</li>
<li>Hindsight (data mining; for Busy Deciders and Sceptical Avoiders)</li>
<li>Foresight (always strategic; trends and futures)</li>
<li>Orientation (immersion; to build user centricity)</li>
<li>Operations (democratisation)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What's next:<ul>
<li>Evaluate your research functions (how does your research contribute to what stakeholders need?)</li>
<li>Develop a diverse range of methods</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
