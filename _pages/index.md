Hello, I'm Zinzy (she/they). I build digital products, currently serving as Product & Design Manager at [Leeruniek](/leeruniek). I've been building websites, products, and teams for 15 years. I moonlight as a queer facilitator with [Vine & Fig](/vine-and-fig) and [Queer Salon](/queer-salon). I live in Amsterdam's finest neighborhood with [my dynamite partner](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/anjawaleson/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55).

This is my personal site, a place I come to link and think. It contains a [changelog](#changelog) with casual updates on a variety of subjects, as well as a collection of loosely-related notes and things I watch, read, and listen to. This space is designed like a scavenger hunt. A good place to start is my <mark><a href="/now">now page</a></mark>.

Learn more about my [work](/work), or [contact](/contact) me.
