Hey pal, I'm Zinzy (she/they). I build digital products and resonant queer spaces. I live in Amsterdam's finest neighborhood with [my dynamite partner](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/anjawaleson/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55).

I'm glad you made it to my corner of the Internet. I come here to link and think. This space contains a changelog with casual updates, as well as a collection of loosely-related notes and things I watch, read, and listen to. A good place to start is my [now page](/now).
