## Title


It has been snowing in Amsterdam. As the years go by, I'm having trouble understanding whether I'm experiencing the effects of global warming, or whether I've never paid attention to what was alaays in front of me until now. It is likely a combination of the two. Either way, it is sad to see Amsterdammers retreat into their homes after two weeks of shorts and drinks in the sun.

I've been watching a lot of Dutch documentaries on the effects Internet culture has on children. [2doc](https://www.2doc.nl/documentaires/collecties/themas/toekomst/internet.html) has a selection. I particularly enjoyed _My Daughter, the Vlogger_. I can't imagine what it's like to raise a child, and I can't imagine what it would be like in 2022. Still, "all her peers will have a YouTube channel by the time they are six, she might as well get a leg up" sounds sad coming out of the mouth of a 3-year-old's mother.
