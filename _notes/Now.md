## At work
I'm at Leeruniek focused on creating a user-focused mode of collaboration. It's great fun work with collewgues from outside the product team, and develop a shared understanding of what we and what we do mean to our customers. Part of this effort involves cultivating a culture of receiving and giving feedback, something I find very refreshing. We're also hiring in the product team and we've already found a new engineer and a new designer. I'm looking forward to exploring our new team setup.
