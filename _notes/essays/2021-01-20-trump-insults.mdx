### "He's a mental basketcase"
Originally tweeted to criticize conservative commentator Glenn Beck about his love of super PACs, this statement would work just fine to describe a middle-aged Arizona native who thought that what the world was missing was a country music opera.
 
### “A loser who sadly plays right into our opponents hands!” 
Part of a Twitter rant unleashed when Justin Amash called Trump's actions impeachable, this line is actually perfect for a sing-off in which one of the contestants blows their shot because they keep pointing the microphone at the audience each time it's their turn to sing.

### “Will destroy the State”
This, of course, was a promise made on behalf of former member of the Georgia House of Representatives, chair of Fair Fight 2020, and all-round power house to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude, Stacey Abrams. I think the statement's much better suited for that moment when either Fergie or Roseanne comes on stage to sing the national anthem again.

### “Just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it’s far too late.”
A cheap shot at Jeb Bush, this excellent piece of shade is much more appropriate coming from a disgruntled has-been judge who, upon seeing Elton John enter the stage, has a live-televized meltdown in front of everyone because Elton kicked him out of Bluesology in 1963.
 
### "Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever"
Referring to the 2018 chemical attack in Syria, Trump really gave us the gift that keeps on giving if we take into account the six-year-old girl who sings such a powerful rendition of _Frozen_'s "Let It Go" that it causes a renewed global interest in the franchise, cementing the fate of millions of parents everywhere.
