excerpt: "Some notes on this website and how and why I maintain it."
---
zinzy.website is my personal site. A quiet corner of the Internet where I come to think aloud. It reminds me of the days when the things we share on the web were less of a monolith.

This space has been around since 2004, in a variety of shapes and under a lot of different names. It has been a blog, a photo blog, a portfolio, and a one-pager. At present, it is a collection of loosely-related notes, maintained in public. 

## Setup
For some time now I've been maintaining my site using Gatsby. I host its contents on Github, and publish using Netlify.

## To do
- Update site automatically with content from Obsidian
- Dark mode
- Note list sorted descending by date
- Search
- Photo archive
- Refactor code
- Mobile typography
- Mobile bottom menu
- Now archive
