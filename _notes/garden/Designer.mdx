I'm a product designer and user experience strategist with thirteen years of skin in the game. In particular, I focus on building tools that people use to solve problems at work.

In 2020 I joined the wonderful team of [Leeruniek](https://www.leeruniek.nl), a startup in education technology. Before that I lead design at travel technology company [Airtrade](https://www.airtrade.com) for five years. I cut my creative teeth working out of my one-woman Studio Zinzy between 2008 and 2014.
