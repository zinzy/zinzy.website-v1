For 15 years I've been making products for the Internet. I've worked in big teams, managed small ones, and wore different hats as the owner of a one-person design studio. This page explores my work history, and in particular the practices I've learnt to make an impact.
    
## My work history and present

### Leeruniek (since 2020)
At the moment I serve as Leeruniek's Product & Design Manager. My job is quite diverse, taking me from the very tangible managing of our product backlog to broader implementation of a user-centered practice.
