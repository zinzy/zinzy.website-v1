For 15 years I've been making products for the Internet. I've worked in big teams, managed small ones, and wore different hats as the owner of a one-person design studio. This page explores my work history, and in particular the practices I've learnt to make an impact.
    
## My work history and present

### Leeruniek (since 2020)
At the moment I serve as Leeruniek's Product & Design Manager. My job is quite diverse, taking me from the very tangible managing of our product backlog to broader implementation of a user-centered practice. I'm responsible for managing our designers, and I collaborate closely with people across the company to allow for our products and services to align smoothly.

### Airtrade (2015 - 2020)
Originally coming in as lead front-end developer, I transitioned to design lead at this travel technology company. I worked on both consumer and enterprise products for brands such as KLM, Transavia, and D-Reizen. As the company's first designer, I built a UX lab from scratch, as well as a design system powering a handful of web apps and a dozen brand identities.

### Studio Zinzy (2008 - 2015)
From the time I was in University, I ran my own design studio, delivering small and big web-based projects to a variety of clients, from local health care providers to literary magazines, and from churches to academic teams.
