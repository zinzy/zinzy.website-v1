# Ali & Ava
I went to see this film on May 26, 2022, thinking it would be a bit of a boring rom com. I couldn't have been more wrong, but I'm chalking it up to my lack of exposure to art house cinema during the pandemic. 

The story of Ali and Ava lingers like a Zadie Smith novel. It's kind, newly sincere, and quiet.
