# Help
This site serves as a playground to help me build my own <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">static site generator</a>. This <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> is part of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWeb</a>, a community of friendly geeks who appreciate autonomy, hand-made web pages, and digital creativity as much as I do. The weird-looking scavenger hunt vibe is not a bug, it's a feature.

## What is this site meant to do?
This space is a personal website not in the modern sense of the world: it's not a polished, coherent, professional highlight reel of why I am. It's very much a traditional personal site: my digital living room, where I get to play, experiment, start, and stop. I love that part of the Internet, where things are a bit weird, and where people get to share more of themselves than the limits to which large brands confine them.

## Why does this site look... unfinished?
I don't know when you're reading this, but chances are that, when you do, this website looks unusual in one way or another. As a designer, my days are made up of making decisions that benefit both the people who use my creations and the people who pay me to make them. On this website, all bets are off. I happen to love the way Times New Roman in black looks against a white canvas.
