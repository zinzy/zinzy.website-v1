# Help
This site serves as a playground to help me build my own <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">static site generator</a>. This <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> is part of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWeb</a>, a community of friendly geeks who appreciate autonomy, hand-made web pages, and digital creativity as much as I do. The weird-looking scavenger hunt vibe is not a bug, it's a feature.

## What is this site meant to do?
This space is a personal website not in the modern sense of the world: it's not a polished, coherent, professional highlight reel of why I am. It's very much a traditional personal site.

## Why does this site look... unfinished?
I don't know when you're reading this, but chances are that, when you do, this website looks unusual in one way or another.
