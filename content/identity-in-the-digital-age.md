# Identity in the digital age
- How do I share my creativity and personality online while making sure my presentation is professional?
- How can I create a holistic representation of myself only that takes anyone and no one as the implied reader?
- Do I need a slick portfolio as a designer?
- If I call myself a designer, should I follow industry conventions on my website?
