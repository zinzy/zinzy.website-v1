# Academic opportunities
The Dutch education system ranks number one in Europe when it comes to early segregation of pupils into levels: the split happens at age 12.

One frequently overheard platitude that I hear education professionals say a lot is that teachers are responsible for helping children move as high up the ladder as they can. After all, higher up means more opportunities.

What these people may forget is that a larger amount of career opportunities does not equal better opportunities, particularly if a pupil's way of learning does not benefit from a certain level. This perspective also ignores that pupil-focused ascension on the ladder only increases the existing disparaties in the educational quality of certain levels
