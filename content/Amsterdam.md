# Amsterdam
I live in Indische Buurt, the finest neighborhood in Amsterdam. I've been in the city since 2015. Like many people in this city, the fact that I wasn't born here only intensifies our love affair. Surprisingly enough, before I lived here, I despised the city. I suspect it has a lot to do with feeling like I couldn't belong.

## Why Amsterdam works for me
To my surprise, when Dutch people from outside of the city tell me about Amsterdam, they usually assume I'm here for the culture and proximity to commercial innovation. Having grown up in the South of the Netherlands as a queer person of color, I've become intimately familiar with what it means to be The Other. Next to Rotterdam, Amsterdam is the only place in the country that doesn't further cultivate that feeling. It's been a healing experience for me to call this city home.
