### Where I stay
Whenever we go to Paris, we stay at [Grand Pigalle Hôtel](https://www.grandpigalle.com/). The staff is friendly but not too friendly, the room service is awesome, and the rooms are the perfect accessory to pretending you're a Parisian for a few days.

### Where I eat
- One benefit of Grand Pigalle that cannot be overlooked is the fact that it's across from [Buvette](https://ilovebuvette.com)
- As a person who loves Japanese milk bread (if you don't, God help you), I never miss out on a visit to [Carré Pain de Mie](https://en.carrepaindemie.com)
