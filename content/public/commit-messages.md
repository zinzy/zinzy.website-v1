# Commit messages 
In my travels across the Internet, I frequently find myself peaking into the code bases of websites I come across. If I'm lucky, it's code I understand and that I can use for my own project. If I'm even luckier, the person who wrote the code leaves a funny trail of the experience they had writing the code.

When I'm working with a new framework or programming language, I sometimes feel isolated and silly for not knowing how one thing or another might work. Reading these commit messages makes me feel better about the state of the world.
