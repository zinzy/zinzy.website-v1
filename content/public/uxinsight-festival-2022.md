### Intro

### Being in possible futures?
by [Sarah Pink](sarah-pink.md)

- Didn't use slides, doesn't like them on a big screen when she's not there in person, will show video and images of projects
- Trailer "Digital Energy Futures"
	- Automatically charging devices
	- Giving up control to system that optimizes energy use
	- Is it realistic / desirable?
	- Project generates new insights about trends by investigating people's lives and futures
	- "Automation takes choice away"
	- Optimizing **every-day lives**
	- Technology should be aligned with human futures
	- "Technology should expand what you can do, not restrict it"
- Project:
	- Good example of research she does
	- She's a design anthropologist: tries to get into people's lives with them, spends time in every-day worlds
	- Uses film in most of her work as a way of exploring lives, participatory observation
- Broken starting point to use your own perspective
	- Example: bought a house, wanted it to be different
	- Third room in the attic
	- Could sense / feel what that future would be like
	- The way we experience futures isn't always we can talk about, sometimes it's very sensual
	- We need research methods to help people think of these futures, that's why film can be interesting
	- It's difficult to speak about but easier to do in performative ways
	- Her books
		- "Doing Visual Ethnography"
		- "Doing Sensory Ethnography"
		- "Everyday Automation" (edited)
			- Looking at automation through every-day lives
			- People do things differently from what industry can imagine
				- Examples: 
					- Myth: set and forget, We assume people want to set up automated system and forgot "set and forget" system, but research shows that people want to have an active relationship with a system
					- Myth: people want automation: Most people don't want full automation, even though industry thinks we do (people will use separate technologies)
					- Myth: charging electric vehicles at work, research shows people want to do it at home at night
- Sometimes we want to experience what possible futures might feel like
	- that's where we can find out what values, priorities might be, what kind of ethics, how will all of this guide them?
	- it's difficult to ask it, she's developed methods to do this research:
		- experiment with people going into possible futures, studying self-driving cars: ask people to drive simulated / Wizard of Oz / automated car, person doesn't know it's not a self-driving car, people experienced life as they never did
		- other study: cocreate possible future air technologies, research shows that air heating and cooling would also person purification. Question: invent the tech, but also role-play being the technology, this helped researchers understand values 
	- city of Melbourne: where are the sensors in the park (sensor for air quality etc., how much rubish in the bin, how many people sit on the bench): what if you were a sensor, what would you measure, who would you share the data with?
- Future-focused methods, what other methods does Sarah use? Can I see it in her research?
- "Smart Homes for Seniors"
	- Based on visual ethnography
	- Selected a group of seniors to participate in documentary
	- As researchers they learned how seniors used smart home technology
- Question from Odette Jansen
- Question from Danielle Duijst: Thanks for your interesting talk Sarah. I'm just curious how do you come up with these creative research methods? Any specific approach you take for that
	- Ethnographic documentary film methods
	- She trained as an anthropological film maker 
	- Sensor method: brainstorm "how do we find the best way to engage people?"
		- They tested the method themselves
		- Damn that's interesting, research method design
		- We don't use the same method again

#### Thoughts afterwards

- What's the value of saying "future"? Wouldn't "solution space" be enough? Or is that too focused on working towards evaluative research, and is the focus here more exploratory


### Leverage Secondary Research in your Practice
By [Xenia Avezov](xenia-avezov.md)

- Why and how, not just to enrich career but to get a fuller data set
- Chronically underused in UXR/tech
- Better understand context
- Build on flawed and limited sample sets
- Product orgs want customer feedback: "would users 'like' this?" (that's not what I do, define target audience > behavior/attitudinal data)
- Stakeholders love a good quote (NPS scores :eyeroll:)
- We're overly indexing primary research
- We think that if we learn from users, but that's not it
- We rarely get to do the research we want to do, there are constraints:
	- Academics start by understanding the state of the art by doing secondary research
	- We have a negative bias about secondary research, we want to make the stuff ourselves
	- What's wrong with our echo? 
	- Effort justification theory: if we apply more effort it must be more worthwhile
		- Cognitive dissonance
		- Xenia thinks that's how we value primary research
- Generic types of research
	- Impractical without secondary research
		- Exploratory: what problems should we solve?
		- Foundational: how do people experience a problem?
	- Impractical without primary research
	- Generative: what solution can solve this problem?
	- Evaluative: does the solution work?
	- Or look at it as a spectrum: learn heavily on primary / secondary research
- Overreliance on primary research
	- Indexes practice towards what and how = solution space
- Simon Sinek "Start With Why"
	- The golden triangle: leaders, products, and organisations start with the why
	- Fully understanding why / purpose makes them more effective
- Secondary research uncovers context users live in
	- Leans heavily on the why
	- Not just once
	- Researchers can't afford to answer the questions why once
	- Knowing why makes us more motivated and focused
- Research not grounded in systemic, holistic environment is incomplete
- Systemic thinking 101, Two main paradigms in science:
	- Analysis: reductionism
		- Penguin as the sum of its parts
	- Systems thinking / synthesis / holism
		- How are things interconnected, dependent on one another
- Systems thinking case study
	- Working at HealthTech company, focusing on diabetic patients
	- Company decided to pivot to solving more problems for patients
	- Process to identify conditions to research
	- Tried to understand: how do diabetic patients experience health care, what kind of gaps can we fill?
	- Where to start with secondary research?
		- Applying system analysis helped:
			- Start by identifying the systems people belong to (found two: biological, intersectional factors that affect health; healthcare system)
			- Took each systems and identified elements in each system, how do systems connect with each other
			- Helped them scope what to ask patients in primary research
- How does secondary research change ability to be strategic?
- How we can be more strategic
	- As researchers we can help organization solve the right problem at the right time for the right people
- Question: top 3 best practices for secondary research
	- Outline: identify system so I can ask many questions in the outline as possible, what direction and shape do I want to scope this in, then narrow it down
	- Letting go: you're trying to carve balance between what you found out and where stakeholders are at. Only your deepest nerdy friends are gonna know what you know.
- Question: what sources do you use to gain that data?
	- Nerding out: brainstorm for sources 
	- It depends on your domain: in this domain, where would I have information?
	- Statistical info available, associations, previous research, etc.
	- Look at the footnotes
	- Librarians are really good at this
		- Her favorite librarian would help her brainstorm
- Question: did your research strategy change?
	- Her career strategy is "don't ask, just do whatever you want"
	-  "I don't expect a patient to understand how their biological context affected their choices"
	- I want to help understand what a patient says, and give it respect and context and texture
	- Sample sizes: tech does research too quickly, not academic
	- I'm scared of not getting the right sample size, or research halting progress
- Question: how do you scope secondary research?
	- Have fun, get creative
	- Discuss it with people
- Question ???
	- Educate people as a researcher
	- Centralize internal insights

### The Power of Saying No
By Ilse Blom

- The ROI of UXR is becoming more clear, but the questions are outweighing the velocity of research
- Saying no can help: it's difficult because we're human and we're researchers 
- If we deliver insights, others need to act
- UXR mission > vission > goal
	- Why do we exist?
	- Where are we heading as a team?
	- How to progress in that direction?
	- Mission can last forever, vision is 2-3 years
- Team workshop:
	- What were we most proud of in the last year?
	- Wouldn't it be fantastic if...
- Mission: "We as UXR team help product teams understand and empathize with the needs and experience of their users so they can develop..."
