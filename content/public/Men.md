*Men* is one of those stories that make me think of starting a GoFundMe for all those movies that ended up sucking because of their terrible ending. [Hereditary](/hereditary) is also there. 

- I'm disappointed that this was made by a man. I fantasize that this story, in the hands of a woman, would've made perfect sense because there are so many elements that work in the paradigm of gender and regarding masculinity. 
- I don't get how the town works. All men are the same, but women aren't (police officers) and on top of that there just are very few women. What do the men mean? Are they all part of the same organism, put in place to help Harper overcome trauma?
- Should I be concerned that I didn't consider the behavior of these men outright toxic or predatory? Perhaps it's because I was reading the scenes differently. 
- The bit in the tunnel, my favorite, reminds me of _kol isha_
