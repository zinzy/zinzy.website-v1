# Ali and Ava
I went to see this film on May 26, 2022, thinking it would be a bit of a boring rom com. I couldn't have been more wrong, but I'm chalking it up to my lack of exposure to art house cinema during the pandemic. I've seen it in the theatre three times so far, and it might be my favorite film of the year.

The story of Ali and Ava lingers like a Zadie Smith novel. It's kind, newly sincere, and quiet. There's something very refreshing about seeing a story of love play out across ethnic and cultural differences without the whole thing falling into the type of racial tensions particular to the context of the United States. It's an unromcom.
