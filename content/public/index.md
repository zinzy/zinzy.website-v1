# Hello, I'm Zinzy Waleson
Welcome to my home on the Internet. This decidedly awkward-looking personal site is where I come to link and think, and where I collect information about my projects, opinions, and things that catch my attention.

## Nice to have you here

- I moonlight as a **queer facilitator**, currently at [Vine & Fig](/vine-and-fig) and [Queer Salon](/queer-salon).
- I [mentor](/mentoring) designers, researchers, and product managers
- I live in the best part of [Amsterdam](/amsterdam)
- I don't participate in social media, but I quite like receiving [emails](mailto:zinzy@pm.me) from kind strangers and connecting with peers on LinkedIn
- I'm an **IndieWeb enthusiast**, which has implications for how this website looks and works. [Learn more about what that means](/start)
- My [now](/now) page will give you a quick overview of what I'm focused on in life at the moment
