# Hello, I'm Zinzy Waleson
Welcome to my home on the Internet. 

I am a designer, facilitator, and IndieWeb enthusiast from [Amsterdam](/amsterdam). This is where I collect information about my projects, opinions, and things that catch my attention.

## Start
Thank you for visiting my personal website. I come here to link and think, share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. If you'd like to know more about why this website is the way it is, check [start](/start).

- **Mentoring:** I reserve some hours each week to mentor peers in design, research, and product management. Read more about [how I mentor](/mentoring).
