# Hello, I'm Zinzy Waleson
Welcome to my home on the Internet. 

I am a designer, facilitator, and IndieWeb enthusiast from [Amsterdam](/amsterdam). This is where I collect information about my projects, opinions, and things that catch my attention. I don't participate in social media, but you may send me an <a href="mailto:zinzy@pm.me">email</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zinzy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.

## (Right) now
I maintain a [/Now](/now) page to provide readers with a quick overview of what I'm focused on in life at the moment. If you're looking for a more detailed look into my life, check my [changelog](/changelog).

### Some things I'm actively working on
- [Commit messages](commit-messages), a look into the hilariously quiet conversation we're all having with our computers
- [Opinions](private/opinions.md)
- I'm attending [UXinsight Festival 2022](uxinsight-festival-2022) and keeping notes

## About this space
Thank you for visiting my personal website. I come here to link and think, share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. If you'd like to know more about why this website is the way it is, check [start](/start).

## About my work
I'm a people nerd. For fifteen years, I've been researching, designing, and building things for the Internet. Having gained experience with brands large and small and solutions for consumers as well as businesses, I've come to specialize in building tools that help people solve problems at work. At the moment, I'm a happy member of the tribe at <a href="https://leeruniek.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leeruniek</a>, a scale-up in educational technology. If you're curious, you can [read more about my work](/work).

## Mentoring
Since March 2022 I've been a part of ADPList's international community of mentors. At the moment, I'm available for mentoring on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You may book a free session with me via <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADPList</a>, or learn more about  [how I mentor](/mentoring).

## Facilitation
I moonlight as a queer Catholic facilitator. I'm part of the leadership team of <a href="https://vineandfig.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vine & Fig</a>, an international community for queer Catholics. When not on hiatus, I host <a href="https://meetup.com/queersalon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Queer Salon</a> every last Sunday of the month in Amsterdam.
