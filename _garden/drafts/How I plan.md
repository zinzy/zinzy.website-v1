1. Review projects list to see what I need to work on this week
2. Review my calendar to see what events I have to prepare for
3. Write in a paragraph what I want to accomplish in the upcoming week
4. Tag all relevant actions #next, and create new actions where necessary
5. Defer actions to appropriate days, so that I'm left with a "Today" list
