I'm Zinzy. I'm a designer and facilitator living and working in Amsterdam. I'm currently at Leeruniek cultivating better design thinking.

This is my personal site, a place you may visit to learn about the things I like, don't understand, and learn. Read more about it in my [[Colophon]].

You may find me on the Amsterdam East side tending to the home and notes I share with Anja. I enjoy making music, learning the love language of cooking, and exploring the worlds of theology, sociolinguistics, and technology ethics. I'm a fan of Barbra Streisand, stellar cinema, and truly terrible television. Life is good.

Please reach out via <a href="mailto:zinzy@pm.me">email</a> if you’re so inclined. If you'd like to learn about what's keeping me busy these days, visit my [now](/now) page.
