The week is surprisingly simple. Contrary to what my mind tells me, I let my body rest on Wednesday. Terrible shark movies and napping on the couch. We celebrate King's Day by having Thanksgiving dinner at my mother-in-law's. My first stuffing.

The neighborhood outdoor pool opens up for the season. It's the best place in town to practice my stroke, or to float. I wait in line next to the other overly excited swimmers as we discuss the boundaries of the weather conditions under which I would still enter the water. At this point in the year, I'm so desperate to swim that I say "thunder". I smile as I am handed my swim pass, which is warm from the lamination machine. "Zinzy Waleson", swimmer. 

Continuing my practice of asking for what I need, I ask the baristas at my coffee spot if they can sell me the type of mug I love. Justus Bruns taps me on the shoulder and asks if I know the woman in the LinkedIn profile on his phone. "Zinzy Waleson". As he picks up our coffee he casually drops his most prized possession into my arms. The boy is nine months old, curious wide eyes, all smiles. He gets it from his dad, I conclude. Unlike last time, I feel like more of a designer next to Justus now. 

They leave to take G.'s mom to Keukenhof. "Our thirties are so much easier", we agree.
