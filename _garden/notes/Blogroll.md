As much as I love how most of our Internet use is spread out between visiting a few high-traffic websites, and searching the web, I miss the old days of the blogroll. A long list of links in someone's blog sidebar was how I got around on the web for years and years. This page contains a growing list of the websites I love, and short notes on why I do. 

### Communities
- [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/): a fan of principles of independent web publishing, I go to this site to explore topics, find inspiration in others' personal sites, and discover new technologies.
- [Postsecret](https://postsecret.com): since 2006, every Sunday morning, like clockwork, I think "new secrets!"
, go to this site, and read them. I am a hopeful human. To me, the "Everyone who knew me before 9/11 thinks I'm dead" one is real.

### Cooking
If I've learnt one thing in life, it's that "I just see what's in the cupboards and start making magic" doesn't work unless you've got a foundation to work from. That foundation is built with good recipes, designer and curated with care. These people do a great job of that.

- [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/): if you're not only into East-Asian stuff but you also want to know why and how it works, Namiko Hirasawa Chen is your gal. 
- [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/): Deb Perelman is what I imagine Nigella Lawson is to some people. She's my go-to person for weeknight recipes and pastries. Most meal planning sessions start here. 
- [Alexandra Cooks](https://alexandracooks.com/): this website has excellent vegetarian recipes, another favorite for our meal planning. 
- [Binging with Babish]: despite the eating disorder connotations that this title raises with me, I love how Andrew Rea transforms literal TV dinners into magic. 

### Shops
- [Jetpens](https://www.jetpens.com/): I swear, if it weren't for Jetpens, I'd finally be able to embrace a minimalist mindset. The bulk of my office supplies come from this store. I love their guides and large collection. 

### Games
- [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html): I never thought I'd get into a derivative of the Dutch 90s show "Lingo" as much as I do, but Wordle has become a daily routine for me. I like how it's a part of the slow web without ever saying the word.
- [Heardle](https://heardle.app): I already [[Heardle|wrote about it]], but it deserves a mention here as well. I love Heardle, because it reminds me of great songs and because I find delight in being able to recognize them instantly. Knowing I'm not the only one, I think I am very good at it. : I never thought I'd get into a derivative of the Dutch 90s show "Lingo" as much as I do, but Wordle has become a daily routine for me. I l
