### I'm thinking of moving into UX. Can we chat?
Sure! Check out my [[mentoring]] page to see if I have any availability.

### Can I interview you for my podcast?
Probably! I enjoy speaking about intersectionality, anti-racism, queer Christianity, and what it means to be a queer Afropean Catholic. Send me an [[About|email]] and I'll let you know if I have time.

### Can you help me with my personal brand / logo / website?
No. While I enjoyed running my own design studio for seven years, my design efforts these days are geared towards tools that people use at work.
