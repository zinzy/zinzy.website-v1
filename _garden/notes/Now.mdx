## At work
I'm at Leeruniek focused on creating a user-focused mode of collaboration. It's great fun work with collewgues from outside the product team, and develop a shared understanding of what we and what we do mean to our customers. Part of this effort involves cultivating a culture of receiving and giving feedback, something I find very refreshing. We're also hiring in the product team and we've already found a new engineer and a new designer. I'm looking forward to exploring our new team setup.

Inspired by the good [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs), this page is a regularly-updated broader horizon of what I'm working on, curious about, and interested in.

### September
Every year, without fail, I find myself longing for Autumn in the middle of Summer. I'm looking forward to cups of tea, blankets, and rainy afternoons. Much like the characters in _You've Got Mail_, I love September because it reminds me of freshly-sharpened pencils and other things that prompt a back-to-school vibe. I'm also looking forward to quilting a prayer mat.

#### What I'm enjoying
- Spiritual reflections on the Lectio 365 app
- CelinaSpookyBoo's dad jokes and accompanying laugh

#### Researching, considering, eager to discuss
- Chronic shame
