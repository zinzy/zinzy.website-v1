In order to achieve a well-balanced color scheme, Erica Schoonmaker introduced Cohesive Colors in a [Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/166246-My-Secret-for-Color-Schemes). I've been using it for years.

I just noticed that someone made a [web tool](https://javier.xyz/cohesive-colors/) for it.
