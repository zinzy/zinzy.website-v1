I reserve a portion of my time to remotely mentor designers and product managers. I do this because I find gratification in helping others navigate paths with which I'm familiar. An added bonus is that it helps me keep a pulse on how the tech industry is developing. I've been doing this since around 2012. <mark>You may schedule time with me via [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene).</mark>

### Me as a mentor
Here's a short overview of who you'll be speaking with:
- I have **15 years** of experience making digital products
- I'm a **self-taught** designer
- I overcome **imposter syndrome** every day
- My academic background is in **cultural analysis** and theology
- I organize product teams with a **focus on design**
- I like to push mentees just outside of their **comfort zone**

#### Where I can help
- **User advocacy:** I can help you navigate office politics and stakeholder management as you work to be a calm, sincere, not-to-be-messed-with voice for the people who are not in the room.
- **Interdisciplinary collaboration:** By letting you focus on individuals over processes, I can help you learn new ways of communicating in a timely and effective way inside and outside of your team.
- **Inclusivity and diversity:** as a queer person of color with a background in facilitation, I can give you tools to be a colleague who makes people feel belonging, professionally and socially.
- **DesignOps and ResearchOps:** I can help you explore how a more strategic way of looking at operations can benefit the work you do and the result your team produces.
- **Product strategy:** Separating the buzzwords from the best practices, I can help you get started in or further enhance your strategic thinking, and the tools you use to communicate about it.

#### Why I mentor
These days, you can find me on [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene), but my efforts originated on my /mentoring page, following [Diana Kimball Berlin](https://dianaberlin.com/), originator of a distributed mentoring movement:


> Every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have. I believe that hopes, dreams, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and it’s important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others."
