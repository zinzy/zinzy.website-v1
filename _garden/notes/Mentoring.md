As [Diana Kimball Berlin](https://dianaberlin.com/) wrote on her original [/mentoring page](https://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring-is): "every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have. I believe that hopes, dreams, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and it’s important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others."

In March 2022 I became a mentor on [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene), with availability on Tuesday evenings Amsterdam time. If you'd like to brainstorm with me about how you can better meet your current (or future) challenges, feel free to book a session.
