### Why this site exists
zinzy.website is my personal site. A quiet corner of the Internet where I come to link and think. One may wonder, if I'm not selling anything or promoting myself, why this site needs to be here at all. Personal sites remind me of the days when sharing things online was an exploratory kind of goofing off, not personal branding or highlight reels.

This space has been around since 2004, in a variety of shapes and under a lot of different names. It has been a blog, a photo blog, a portfolio, a directory, and a one-pager. Its first name was doyoulikemytightsweater.com. At present, it is a collection of loosely-related notes, maintained in public. 

### Principles
When it comes to publishing things online, I enjoy the idea of owning my data, making my own things, and learning while doing so. I appreciate concepts such as the IndieWeb and slow web. I like to think the Internet deserves to be liberated from our tendencies to turn things into a monolith. My aim with this space is to grow it incrementally and retroactively. I hope to have it be part of the long web.

### Setup
- I build this site using Gatsby, with which I'm familiar enough to be able to use it, and unfamiliar enough that it makes me slightly uncomfortable. Before this, I used Jekyll for years.
- bHosted has been my webhost since 2005.
- The code for this website is stored on Github.
- This website is hosted on Netlify

### Tracking
This website doesn't track those who visit it. I have no idea if you're reading this. Enjoy.
