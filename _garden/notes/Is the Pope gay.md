In January of 2021 I created a one-pager called "Is the Pope gay?". As is the case with so many of my other ideas, I came up with this website because something happened on the Internet: the `.gay` domain extension had just become available. Next to isthepope.gay, I registered a wide variety of domains. My favorite was everyoneatthevaticanis.gay, which led to my own website.

After a year of cheap fun I've let go of all of my `.gay` domains, but this project remains on [Netlify](https://isthepopegay.netlify.app/).
