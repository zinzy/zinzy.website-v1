I'm a digital designer with about 15 years of experience crafting web products for organizations and professionals in the Netherlands and abroad. Approaching design as a strategic effort, my responsibilities are usually quite broad, and often include exploratory and evaluative user and product research, holistic design, setting up design systems, and setting up DesignOps and ResearchOps.
