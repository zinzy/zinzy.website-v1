Introduced by Michael Bungay Stanier, the seven questions can help people, particularly those in leadership positions, become better at helping others. 

1. What’s on your mind?
2. And what else?
3. What’s the real challenge here for you?
4. What do you want
5. How can I help?
6. If you’re saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?
7. What was most useful for you?

I first learned about this concept while listening to [[Dare to Lead on the advice trap]].
