The digital notes is the latest trend in online publishing: a publicly available collection of notes in various stages of refinement, tended to and updated online for everyone to see. It sits snuggly in between a blog and a one-person wiki. 

To me, it’s the culmination of the folder plain text files I’ve been maintaining since around 2005, which exist in my [[Second brain]]. The ones you can see here have been made available to the public. the vast majority of them are kept private for a myriad of reasons.
