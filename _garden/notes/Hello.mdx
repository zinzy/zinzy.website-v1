I'm Zinzy. I build digital products, and resonant queer spaces. I live and work in Amsterdam. This here is my personal site, which I use to link and think. 

For 15 years, I’ve been applying my skills in research, design, strategy, and leadership to making things for the Internet. I’ve worked in a variety of industries, across consumer and enterprise products. Currently, I serve as Product & Design Manager of Leeruniek, a scale-up in education technology. First and foremost, I’m a people nerd.

In Amsterdam and on the Internet I build resonant queer spaces for like-minded individuals. Since 2018, I’ve been hosting Queer Salon every last Sunday of the month. In 2020, I joined the leadership team of Vine & Fig, and international community for queer Catholics.

You may find me on the Amsterdam East side tending to the home and notes I share with Anja. I enjoy making music, learning the love language of cooking, and exploring the worlds of theology, sociolinguistics, and technology ethics. I'm a fan of Barbra Streisand, stellar cinema, and truly terrible television. Life is good.
