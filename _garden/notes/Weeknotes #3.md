It took a while before I settled into a suitable solution for the way I produce content on this website. I write Markdown, and had set up [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) in case I ever needed some more complexity in my content files. I would mostly update content through my desktop client, but have [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) for iOS installed, which I enjoy as much as anyone could enjoy a touchscreen Git client. I was missing some functionalities that are native to the way I generally write, and so I decided to move my content into an Obsidian vault.
