I'm interested in how speech acts help us define the world around us, and in the effects they have on our meaning-making abilities, and mental health.

### Illocutionary speech act

An illocutionary speech act is an expression by a person that presents both information and action. It is an utterance that brings into being social facts. A simple example is "I now pronounce you wife and wife".

I am fascinated by illocutionary speech acts and their use in establishing personal evaluations as social facts as well as their ability to relieve the tension of cognitive dissonance in these areas (and others):
- Racism ("[[Stop saying race]]")
- Parenthood
- Sexism
- Sexual violence
