Much like Clara, I very much enjoy browsing the IndieWeb using the navigation in the bottom left corner of this site. When I stumbled upon this page, and saw my website listed as one of Clara's new finds,y heart skipped a beat. Since I don't make an effort to be found on the Internet, I forget people ever even find my website. I imagine this is what it must feel like to make contact again with another human after an apocalypse, divided by 1,000.
