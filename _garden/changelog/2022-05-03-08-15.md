Great work on setting up your first personal website, Deborah, and welcome to the IndieWeb! Watching my personal Internet heroes help you wade into the waters of independent web publishing was so refreshing for me. Not all corners of the Internet are welcoming to new faces, but I hope you had as great a time as I had at our first [IndieWebCamp](https://indieweb.org/2022/D%C3%BCsseldorf)!
