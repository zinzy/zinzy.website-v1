Much like you, I very much enjoy browsing the IndieWeb using [Indieweb webrings](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/). When I stumbled upon your post, and saw my website listed as one of your new finds, my heart skipped a beat. Since I don't make an effort to be found on the Internet, I forget people ever even find my website. I imagine this is what it must feel like to make contact again with another human after an apocalypse, divided by 1,000.
