RSVP'd to my first-ever Homebrew get-together on May 4th. I'm curious to see who will be there, and a tad nervous about not being dorky enough. A while ago I made the distinction between Anja and myself by saying she's a full-on dork, and I'm a dork with a hint of cool because I'm in IT, and then she rolled her eyes at me by using her eyes and, really, her entire head.
