![Pieces of a Woman](./pieces-of-a-woman.png)

[_Pieces of a Woman_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11161474/) is the first film that made me feel like someone was actually giving birth on screen. It's also a really wonderful way to get to know the work of [Vanessa Kirby](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3948952/?ref_=tt_cl_t1), who is a blast both here and on [_The Crown_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_11).
