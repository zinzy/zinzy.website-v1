This television series goes to show that, if I weren't a lesbian, I would probably be at risk of [writing men in prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybristophilia). Binging through this entire show in three days, I managed to entangle myself in the violent and perfectly-aesthetic vulnerability of the show's serial killer so thoroughly that, months on, I still can't break free.
