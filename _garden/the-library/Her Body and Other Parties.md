This book helped me remember how much I do, in fact, love the genre of uncanny gothic short fiction. Reading "The Husband Stitch", I felt an old, familiar thrill, which culminated in a small gasp as I got to the end. Reading this book is like having somebody tell you your first urban legend. Gorgeous. Terrifying.
