_The Undoing_ is at once a brilliant series that confirmed to me the talent of Hugh Grant, and that leaves me wondering: does it know what kind of show it is?

After binging it in late April, Anja and I almost immediately fell into a discussion about red herrings, and the boundary between that and confused storytelling. I'm not trying to be extra salty here, I just don't think I'm overthinking it when I say that this show is the perfect example of a red herring that is so big it misses the entire point. 

Grace's instant recognizability as an unreliable narrator makes for a great watch. The visual storytelling of this show is something thing I haven't seen in a long while. I'm not talking about the stylistic choices that shows like [[severance|Severance]] make. _The Undoing_ is deliciously subdued. The same weird building that sits in between scenes, Grace's focalization telling us nothing other than the horrors she imagines, the school mom who gets too much screen time, childhood images of Grace playing. There is a ton of stuff to work with, and as a [[visual literacy]] nerd I take it all into account while watching. 

I loved the show, and I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire time. Yet, looking back at it, I feel like the show asked me "what am I?" more than I think fit its contents.
