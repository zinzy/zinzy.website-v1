I started watching _Riverdale_ to distract myself from the sadness that came over me as soon as I completed the entire series of _Desperate Housewives_[^1]. Anticipating its ability to awaken my nostalgia for a high school experience I never had, I've actually been quite impressed by:

- The show's skillful mixing of detective staples and high school drama
- Lili Reinhart's embodiment of Betty Cooper, and her ability to carry sweetness and unease in single scene
- The show's intertextuality (other high school and small town dramas, _Contact_, etc.)

Like so many other shows, one mistake I would love to see _Riverdale_ overcome is the erasure of racism and ethnicity. It places Black bodies at the margins of its narratives, letting them set the backdrop against which three White teenagers and one Latinx teenager self actualize. Black bodies fill narrative gaps as musicians, short order cooks, sexual predators, conniving angry women, thugs, or athletes. Addressing racist issues is a youthful act, reserved for high school students who fail to see what is of actual importance.
