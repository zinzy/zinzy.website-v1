I saw _Midsommar_ in a theatre in the Summer of 2019. Florence Pugh might be my favorite actress of her generation. The way she grieves, cry-stumbling over her own coughs, and the way her face moves kept me glued to the screen. 

The photography and sound design of this film are something else. I'm sure, comparing it to [[hereditary]] I'll be able to sraw parallels in Ari Aster's directing, but when I watch _Midsommar_, I feel it is unlike anything I've ever seen. The intoxicating sounds of the small Swedish commune, and the bright colors add to the film's uncanniness, and I like it they way.

It reminds me of _[Devils & Angels: Ritual Feasts in Europe](https://www.frisospoelstra.com/portfolio/G0000K5OxBhSJBOw)_ by Friso Spoelstra.

In general, I aim to steer clear of snobbery, but the work of Ari Aster truly is elevated horror, and I'm one of the genre's most shameless fans.
