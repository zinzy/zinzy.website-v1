_Schindler's List_ is most fun to watch when you do it with two Jews: its biggest fan, and a specialist in cultural analysis. This is the privileged life I live with Anja and her mother.

My mother-in-law, a storyteller at heart and a connaisseur of Holocaust films, has told me she thinks _Schindler's List_ is the best film ever made. We watch it annually, in theatres when we can, and I have never not seen her cry.

Anja and I are less moved.

A perpetual conversation the three of us have been having, is about filmmaker's intent, racial reconcilliation, and the very limits of fiction itself. _Schindler's List_ sits with an entire host of films that equate exposure to a particular marginalized group to decreased intolerance of that group. Spielberg, in adapting the non-fiction novel _[Schindler's Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_Ark)_, made the deliberate choice to tell a story in which a nazi self-actualizes against the backdrop of Jewish death and sorrow.

When my mother-in-law thinks of _Schindler_, she thinks of a documentary. Herein lies my main argument for the importance of teaching [[visual literacy]].
