I donâ€™t know _what_ the makers intended for me to feel, but watching [_Klassen_](https://www.2doc.nl/documentaires/series/1doc/2020/klassen.html) has left me positively heart-broken and thankful that I will not ever be called upon to raise a child. 

What makes this documentary so striking, is that it perfectly captures the vulnerability of children left in the care of their families and schools. In fact, I've found it quite heartbreaking to see children, not much different from myself, growing up in equally unsafe homes, and realizing that there is not a thing I can do to stop whatever emptiness they may one day feel.
