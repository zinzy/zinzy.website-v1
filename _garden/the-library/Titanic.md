It is because of this movie that I have been saying for decades:

> The things we love when we're ten are the things we will love forever.

_Titanic_ truly is the prime example of why I, despite everything an education in Humanities taught me, allow myself suspension of disbelief.

### My favorite moments in _Titanic_

- When Molly Brown does everything
- When, after the string quartet has called it quits, the violinist comes back to play one last song
