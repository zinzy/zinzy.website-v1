Following the friendly [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff), I maintain a page of things that are top of mind for me at the moment. 

### From design lead to manager
Like so many other UX professionals in their lifetime, I've recently made the transition from designer to manager. It's a natural fit given the pencils I'm most eager to further sharpen, career-wise. I feel thankful that I have the opportunity to take on this challenge at [Leeruniek](https://www.leeruniek.nl). I've never been in-house at a startup, and to help me better appreciate the dynamics of startup life and management, I'm enjoying reading [The Making of a Manager](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/38821039-the-making-of-a-manager).

### Working from anywhere but home
Due to some changes in our home I no longer work in my home office. I've spent the past few weeks roaming from our office to my favorite coffee place and back, and I'm thankful that I get to borrow [Annelie](https://www.anneliewambeek.com/)'s apartment for a few weeks. I've discovered an unexpected benefit to this development: once I come home, there is no more work.

### How I work
I've recently begun maintaining a document to explain (mostly to myself) [[How I work]].
