If you are not familiar with the serendipitous online love affair that helped one local book shop owner fall for the mega store mogul who sent her business into the ground, I consider it a true pleasure to introduce you to _You've Got Mail_. 

<BreakoutMail/>

Imagine the late nineties. We were on our computers, flirting with the creative geniuses brought out in us by WordArt and Paint. Some of us were building the first personal websites. Others could barely get past the dial-up sound without having a small heart attack. Well-to-do urbanites in their thirties everywhere were not only flirting with Microsoft products, but also with each other.

Spoilers are imminent.

_You've Got Mail_ tells the story of two such people. Kathleen "Shopgirl" Kelly and Joe "NY152" Fox meet in a chatroom one day and strike up a conversation that changes their lives forever. With their messages being the third main character in the movie, their exchanges are read aloud for us to hear. It's a candid display of their inner worlds juxtaposed with the banality of what we watch them do: making breakfast, cleaning the house, walking the dog, walking the streets of the Upper West Side.

The key to why this movie ranks high on my desert island top 10 lies in the opening scene, when we hear NY152 write to Shopgirl:

<Quote/>

While both are in relationships that range from siblingly comfortable to aggressively detached, neither of them had entered the chatroom with the intent of cheating on their partner. Their encounter is unexpected, their conversations lively bursts of chemistry. Meanwhile the streets of New York turn a heartbreakingly beautiful crimson and carmine.  

Unbeknownst to each other, they both work in book retail: Shopgirl inherited The Shop Around the Corner from her mother years ago, and NY152 belongs to the family that runs Foxbooks, a chain of mega stores that will soon be the end of her.

One day, Shopgirl and NY152 will agree to meet in real life, of course, but well before they do Kathleen and Joe have a chance encounter. It is apparent that their chemistry translates well to the offline world, but Kathleen soon finds out that it's none other than Joe Fox as in Foxbooks with whom she's been exchanging soft glances. She accuses him of spying, he mocks her business.

<BreakoutCouples/>

That could've been the end.

The greatest part of any romcom, though, is the way two lovers find their paths back to each other after having fallen out. It is truly the slowest rated-G version of makeup sex that exists in the world today. It's my favorite part of any story and that probably speaks volumes about the type of person I am. It isn't any different with Joe and Kathleen.

Eventually, Joe discovers that Shopgirl is in fact Kathleen — although by this time The Shop Around The Corner has gone under — and once he realizes how he truly feels about her, he engineers for the two of them to build a friendship. Kathleen gets to know Joe beyond his surname and he, in turn, falls deeply in love with her.

In the end, when all the pieces finally fall into place for Kathleen — in a park, while "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" fades in — she displays what I've come to understand is the most beautiful laugh-cry ever produced in American cinema. Through her tears, she admits "I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be you so badly".

<Kathleen/>

There is so much to love about _You've Got Mail_ that I barely know where to start. Aside from the fact that it's embedded in my wider appreciation of how spectacularly narrow the window for such a modern love story really was (late enough for the early majority to have begun using the Internet for dating but early enough that no person outside of the fishing industry ever used the word "catfish"), there is just something so deeply true about what Joe says. 

In my opinion, Autumn _is_ the best season of them all. It always made me want to buy new school supplies, too. Now, it makes me (want to) buy office supplies. The beginning of Autumn is entirely hopeful, in a literal sense because it's the start of a whole new year of learning. This was true for me then as a school girl, and now as a school-enterprise-application-designing girl. The beginning of Autumn turns the world into an ocean of opportunities. 

Aside from rich in opportunity, it's also quieting in myriad ways. Daily schedules go back to normal, everyone's home safe from time abroad, and television programming helps us ease into our comfortable routines once again. Seeing the leaves fall, and watching _You've Got Mail_, makes me want to go and sharpen pencils like the Pavlovian dog that I am. Everything becomes just a little bit more predictable, and therefore 

<Safe/>

Perhaps that's exactly why I love romcoms so much.

I love the simplicity of romcoms: yes, a woman may lose the business her mother built to the man who has humiliated and then seduced her, but in the end everyone is content and in love. These stories have been the happy escapes that I sought to encounter over and over again as a child. The comfort of Autumn, woes-of-the-heart dramas within the confines of a simpler reality: these are the spaces I visit to relax.

After all, if Kathleen Kelly can look on the bright side and see that the man who ruined her business is actually an amazing partner _as well as_ the catalyst to her new children's books authoring career, I can overcome, well... anything. It's one of my most successful mantras. I learned recently that Ted Lasso calls it

<RomCommunism/>

It shouldn't be a surprise to you that the themes about which I'm writing — safety, structure, predictability — find refuge in a much larger, more complex, and truthfully altogether more painful part of my life. One which forces me to look under the covers of what I've been tucking in and kissing goodnight for decades. Writing helps, my kind therapist tells me, and I'm sure of it. It's just a monumental task when the barely-audible-but-not-yet-quiet-enough tape in the my head keeps whispering "you're not worthy of the things you need".

I suppose that's why Joe's quote about the pencils resonates with me so strongly. There is something intentional and anticipatory about the act of pencil sharpening. We assume that once the lead is sharp enough, the words will come, much like the questions and answers and follow-up questions which flow so freely between two new lovers.

And if we're lucky, we get something down on paper before we remember all the things we fear: that we're not worthy of putting our feelings and thoughts into the world, of understanding what we need. Of speaking truth to powerless power.
