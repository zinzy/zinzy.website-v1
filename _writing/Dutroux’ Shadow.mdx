title: Dutroux’ Shadow
---
Dutch newspaper NRC has released a limited series podcast on Marc Dutroux, the Belgian individual who abducted, imprisoned, and raped eleven young girls and murdered a number of them in the late 80s and 90s, recording the abuse in the process. I was nine when the bodies of three of his victims were found in his backyard, wrapped in plastic. I had been warned about “kinderlokkers”, and the fear I was supposed to feel for them didn’t really materialize until Dutroux started dominating the news.

What I quite like about this podcast, is that it has opened my eyes to something I was too young to appreciate at the time: how this case unleashed a societal crisis. A war between politics and civilians, fueled by what one of the journalists interviewed calls “gap discourse”. During and after the trials, a crowd began to gather around the idea that Dutroux was part of a large, satanic cult that engaged in ritualistic child sexual abuse. 

To me, Dutroux was just one in a string of disgusting European middle-aged men with terrible secrets in their basement. I had never heard of the conspiracy theory until this podcast.
