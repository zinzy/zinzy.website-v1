title: How I work
---
This page exists so that I can document (mostly for myself) what's working about the way I choose to conduct my work.

Some background: I work fulltime and mostly-remotely for a tech company in a job that's a mix of project management, design, research, strategy, and leadership. It involves a fair amount of context switching, and requires that I am available for spontaneous calls with team members. At the time of writing, mid-October 2021, I'm doing my best work when I:

- Rigorously time-block my work
- Honor a block of deep work in the morning
- Meditate in the morning
- Write at the end of my workday
