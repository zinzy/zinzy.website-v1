# Zinzy's digital garden
This is the source code for [zinzy.website](https://zinzy.website), the personal website of me, Zinzy Waleson, which contains a growing collection of loosely-related notes.

I am not a developer, and taking a glimpse at my code will tell you instantly. I do not recommend that you fork this project for any kind of use.

## Stack
- Gatsby
- TippyJS
- Bootstrap
- React Bootstrap
- React Icons

## Here be dragons
If you are learning to write code and want to create things on your website that are similar to what I have on mine, please know that none of the work in this repository could be considered production-ready. I develop by necessity, and learn new things every day.
