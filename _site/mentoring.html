                <p>I reserve a portion of my time to remotely mentor designers and product managers. I do this because I find gratification in helping others navigate paths with which I'm familiar. An added bonus is that it helps me keep a pulse on how the tech industry is developing. I've been doing this since around 2012. <mark>You may schedule time with me via [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene).</mark></p>
                <h3 id="me-as-a-mentor">Me as a mentor</h3>
                <p>Here's a short overview of who you'll be speaking with:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I have <strong>15 years</strong> of experience making digital products</li>
                  <li>I'm a <strong>self-taught</strong> designer</li>
                  <li>I overcome <strong>imposter syndrome</strong> every day</li>
                  <li>My academic background is in <strong>cultural analysis</strong> and theology</li>
                  <li>I organize product teams with a <strong>focus on design</strong></li>
                  <li>I like to push mentees just outside of their <strong>comfort zone</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="where-i-can-help">Where I can help</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>User advocacy:</strong> I can help you navigate office politics and stakeholder management as you work to be a calm, sincere, not-to-be-messed-with voice for the people who are not in the room.</li>
                  <li><strong>Interdisciplinary collaboration:</strong> By letting you focus on individuals over processes, I can help you learn new ways of communicating in a timely and effective way inside and outside of your team.</li>
                  <li><strong>Inclusivity and diversity:</strong> as a queer person of color with a background in facilitation, I can give you tools to be a colleague who makes people feel belonging, professionally and socially.</li>
                  <li><strong>DesignOps and ResearchOps:</strong> I can help you explore how a more strategic way of looking at operations can benefit the work you do and the result your team produces.</li>
                  <li><strong>Product strategy:</strong> Separating the buzzwords from the best practices, I can help you get started in or further enhance your strategic thinking, and the tools you use to communicate about it.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="why-i-mentor">Why I mentor</h4>
                <p>These days, you can find me on <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene">ADPList</a>, but my efforts originated on my /mentoring page, following <a href="https://dianaberlin.com/">Diana Kimball Berlin</a>, originator of a distributed mentoring movement:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have. I believe that hopes, dreams, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and it’s important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others."</p>
                  <p>— Diana on her original <a href="https://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring-is">/mentoring page</a></p>
