                    <img src="/assets/img/firstdesign.jpg" /></span> of this website was a lot more ostentatious than what you see here. As I progressed through the development process of this website, the current design started emerging on its own. For reasons I don't even understand, the current design just started feeling more natural than the one I had in my mind initially. The bare and simple look-n-feel of this site, at least to me, encompasses the essence of all the things I love about the sites I frequently visit â€” feed-like structure, previews, search with context, contextual backlinks, sidenotes, etc. I am hopeful that you'll love it too. :)</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Page preview</strong> (Move your mouse over the link): <a class="stale-link" href="javascript:void(0)">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</a></li>
                  <li><strong>Transclusion</strong>: Allows you to see a partial view of the contents of the website to the right or the left of the margin.</li>
                  <li><strong>Sidenotes</strong> (Changelog you see on the left is an example of this).</li>
                  <li><strong>Wiki-style link:</strong> Usually wikis allow you to specify links using double bracket, I added it here using liquid. Also added bad-link highlighting
                    <ul>
                      <li>Good link: <a class="stale-link" href="javascript:void(0)">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</a></li>
