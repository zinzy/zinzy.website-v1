For her podcast _Dare to Lead_, Brené Brown spoke with Michael Bungay Stanier, a specialist in change management and transforming company cultures. Anja told me about this episode.

A few years ago, Bungay Stanier introduced the [[Seven questions]], a set of prompts that can help people, particularly those in leadership positions, become better at helping others. 

People, Stanier suggests, are very keen on giving advice, so much so in fact that they do it even when advice isn’t what others need. He suggests that we stay curious longer, by making space for conversations to flow more openly around these seven questions:

These can prevent the following traps:
- Advice may solve the wrong problem
- The better we think we are at giving advice, the worse we probably are. Cognitive biases prevent us from seeing this, advice wastes people’s time and energy, they may do the wrong thing
- we must ask ourselves: what’s the right leadership act? Hold the space for them to figure out

"When you give someone advice you’re one-upping that person"

Apparently this concept aligns well with the [[Karpman’s drama triangle]]. Research shows that the vast majority of people self-identify as a rescuer. What they (and in turn I) don’t realise, is that rescuers make victims to sustain their identity (my mouth dropped open when I heard this.)

An AA quote that aligns with this is: "help is the sunny side of control."

Advice is reactive help.
